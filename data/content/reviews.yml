      Perfect base for exploring the beautiful island of Crete. 
      A car is a must, plenty of beautiful places within easy driving distance. 
      Quiet location but Kissamos is very close for grocery shopping/holiday essentials. 
      Staff are very friendly and breakfast was wonderful every morning. 
      Can't fault these apartments at all, would highly recommend!
